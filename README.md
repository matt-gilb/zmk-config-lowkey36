# LowKey36 by Matt Gilbert

This is the source repo for the LowKey36 spit keyboard. This board is designed to be used with Nice!Nano controllers and Nice!View displays. The unique feature of this board is that it is designed for the Kailh PG1316S ultra low-profile key switch. These are surface-mounted switches that require special soldering to connect them to the PCB.
